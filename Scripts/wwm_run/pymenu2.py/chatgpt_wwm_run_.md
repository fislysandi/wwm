yes correct. now i want you to modify the code i provided in these 2 code blocks so it will read file named appcache.txt it contains absolute paths to the executables and their icon locations,you should also read the folder named wwm_runner_scripts that will contain python scripts that extends the functionality of wwm_run.py like dmenu you can also pipe those scripts into wwm_run.py to only get functionality of that scripts as menu for that script if nothing is piped it will just read the appcache.txt and run the program.
